It is our aim to create conflict with this project. 

### Royal Penguin (Gian)


### Rockhopper (Abhi, Elizna)


### Add your penguin (and your name)


### Magellanic penguin (Chipo)

Magellanic penguins are named after the explorer Ferdinand Magellan.


They are also sometimes called "Jackass Penguins". 

They have a black back, white belly, and two black bands across their chest.

They are about 2 feet tall and weigh 8-14 pounds.

They are natural swimmers and feed on anchovies, squid, and krill.

They are South American penguins.

Magellanic penguins are near threatened due to fishing, pollution, climate change, and human disturbance, but conservation efforts offer hope.
